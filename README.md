# Trying out Flutter

A collection of Flutter samples.

Contains a sample based off of [Part 1](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/codelab
) and [Part 2](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2/) of the codelabs. It generates a list of "username" suggestions (or github repo names, you might say). Suggestions
can be "liked", and all such "liked" suggestions can be viewed in isolation.


Also contains some of the [Cookbook samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook#animation).
